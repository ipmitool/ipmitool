 * The new way of communicating with the bmc driver is to use putmsg() to
 * send a message of a particular type.  Replies from the driver also have this
 * form, and will require the user to process the type field before examining

 *
 * The only change that must be observed when using the request and response
 * structures defined above is as follows:
 * when sending messages to the bmc driver, the data portion is now variable
 * (the caller must allocate enough space to store the all structure members,
 * plus enough space to cover the amount of data in the request), e.g.:
 *
 * bmc_msg_t *msg = malloc(offsetof(bmc_msg_t, msg) + sizeof(bmc_req_t) + 10);
 *
 * The amount allocated for the message is (# of bytes before the msg field) +
 * the size of a bmc_req_t (which includes SEND_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE
 * bytes in the data field), plus an additional 10 bytes for the data
 * field (so the data field would occupy (SEND_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE + 10)
 * bytes).  The datalength member must reflect the amount of data in the
 * request's data field (as was required when using the ioctl interface).

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program lets you manage Intelligent Platform Management Interface 
(IPMI) functions of either the local system, via a kernel device driver,
or a remote system, using IPMI v1.5 and IPMI v2.0. These functions include
printing FRU information, LAN configuration, sensor readings, and remote
chassis power control.

IPMI management of a local system interface requires a compatible IPMI
kernel driver to be installed and configured.  On Linux this driver is
called \fIOpenIPMI\fP and it is included in standard distributions.
On Solaris this driver is called \fIBMC\fP and is included in Solaris 10.
Management of a remote station requires the IPMI\-over\-LAN interface to be
enabled and configured.  Depending on the particular requirements of each
system it may be possible to enable the LAN interface using
.BR ipmitool
over the system interface.

This value is ignored and always set to ADMINISTRATOR when
combined with \fI-t target address\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-m\fR <\fIlocal_address\fP>
Set the local IPMB address.  The local address defaults to 0x20
or is auto discovered on PICMG platforms when \-m is not specified.
There should be no need to change the local address for normal operation.
.TP 
\fB\-N\fR <\fIsec\fP>
Specify nr. of seconds between retransmissions of lan/lanplus messages.
Defaults are 2 seconds for lan and 1 second for lanplus interfaces.
Command \fIraw\fP uses fixed value of 15 seconds.
Command \fIsol\fP uses fixed value of 1 second.
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR <\fIoemtype\fP>
Select OEM type to support.  This usually involves minor hacks
in place in the code to work around quirks in various BMCs from
various manufacturers.  Use \fI\-o list\fP to see a list of
current supported OEM types.
.TP 
\fB\-O\fR <\fIsel oem\fP>
Open selected file and read OEM SEL event descriptions to be used
during SEL listings.  See examples in contrib dir for file format.

.LP 
If no password method is specified then
.BR ipmitool
will prompt the user for a password. If no password is entered at the prompt,
the remote server password will default to NULL.
.SH "SECURITY"
There are several security issues be be considered before enabling the
IPMI LAN interface. A remote station has the ability to control a system's power 
state as well as being able to gather certain platform information. To reduce 
vulnerability it is strongly advised that the IPMI LAN interface only be 
enabled in 'trusted' environments where system security is not an issue or 
where there is a dedicated secure 'management network'.

Further it is strongly advised that you should not enable IPMI for
remote access without setting a password, and that that password should
not be the same as any other password on that system.

When an IPMI password is changed on a remote machine with the IPMIv1.5
\fIlan\fP interface the new password is sent across the network
as clear text.  This could be observed and then used to attack the remote
system.  It is thus recommended that IPMI password management only be done
over IPMIv2.0 \fIlanplus\fP interface or the system interface on the
local station.

For IPMI v1.5, the maximum password length is 16 characters; longer
passwords might be truncated or rejected by the server, or rejected
by
.BR ipmitool .

For IPMI v2.0, the maximum password length is 20 characters; longer
passwords will be rejected by
.BR ipmitool .

.SH "COMMANDS"
.TP 
\fIhelp\fP
This can be used to get command\-line help on 
.BR ipmitool
commands. It may also be placed at the end of commands to get option usage help.

This command supports the Firmware Firewall capability.  It may be used to 
add or remove security-based restrictions on certain commands/command 
sub-functions  or to list the current firmware firewall restrictions set on 
any commands.  For each firmware firewall command listed below, parameters 
may be included to cause the command to be executed with increasing 
granularity on a specific LUN, for a specific NetFn, for a specific IPMI 
Command, and finally for a specific command's sub-function (see Appendix H in the 
IPMI 2.0 Specification for a listing of any sub-function numbers that may 
be associated with a particular command).

Parameter syntax and dependencies are as follows:

[<\fIchannel\fP \fBH\fR>] [<\fIlun\fP \fBL\fR> [ <\fInetfn\fP \fBN\fR> [<\fIcommand\fP \fBC\fR [<\fIsubfn\fP \fBS\fR>]]]] 

Note that if "netfn <\fBN\fR>" is specified, then "lun <\fBL\fR>" must also be 
specified;  if "command <\fBC\fR>" is specified, then "netfn <\fBN\fR>" (and
therefore "lun <\fBL\fR>") must also be specified, and so forth.

"channel <\fBH\fR>" is an optional and standalone parameter.  If not specified,
the requested operation will be performed on the current channel.  Note that
command support may vary from channel to channel.

Correlates cipher suite numbers with the maximum privilege
level that is allowed to use it.  In this way, cipher suites can restricted
to users with a given privilege level, so that, for example,
administrators are required to use a stronger cipher suite than
normal users.

The format of \fIprivlist\fR is as follows.  Each character represents
a privilege level and the character position identifies the cipher
suite number.  For example, the first character represents cipher
suite 0, the second represents cipher suite 1, and so on.
\fIprivlist\fR must be 15 characters in length.

Characters used in \fIprivlist\fR and their associated privilege levels are:

This is the default behavior for
.BR ipmitool (1).

Try to automatically detect the encoding based on the value of the
version field and (for version 1) the timestamp. The version is
considered valid if it is 1 through 5, and the timestamp is valid
if the year is past or equal to UNIX Epoch (1970) and is before or
equal to the current year.

If multiple encodings happen to have valid version fields, then
precedence takes the one with version 1 and a valid timestamp. If
neither one has that, then the precedence order is as follows:
\fIsmbios\fP, \fIipmi\fP, \fIrfc4122\fP.

If neither encoding yields a valid version field, then
.BR ipmitool (1)
defaults to \fIdump\fP mode.

If this option is in use, then
.BR ipmitool (1)
will also print out the detected encoding and warn

Linux character device interface for the message handler.
.LP 
The following kernel modules must be loaded on
a 2.6\-based kernel in order for
.BR ipmitool
to work:
.TP 
.B ipmi_msghandler
Incoming and outgoing message handler for IPMI interfaces.
.TP 
.B ipmi_si
An IPMI system interface driver for the message handler.
This module supports various IPMI system interfaces such
as KCS, BT, SMIC, and even SMBus in 2.6 kernels.
.TP 
.B ipmi_devintf
Linux character device interface for the message handler.
.LP 
Once the required modules are loaded there will be a dynamic
character device entry that must exist at \fB/dev/ipmi0\fR.
For systems that use devfs or udev this will appear at
\fB/dev/ipmi/0\fR.

To create the device node first determine what dynamic major
number it was assigned by the kernel by looking in
\fB/proc/devices\fR and checking for the \fIipmidev\fP
entry.  Usually if this is the first dynamic device it will
be major number \fB254\fR and the minor number for the first
system interface is \fB0\fR so you would create the device
entry with:

.I mknod /dev/ipmi0 c 254 0

.BR ipmitool
includes some sample initialization scripts that
can perform this task automatically at start\-up.

In order to have
.BR ipmitool
use the OpenIPMI device interface
you can specify it on the command line:
.PP 
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIopen\fP <\fIcommand\fP>
.SH "BMC INTERFACE"
The ipmitool bmc interface utilizes the \fIbmc\fP device driver as
provided by Solaris 10 and higher.  In order to force ipmitool to make
use of this interface you can specify it on the command line:
.PP 
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIbmc\fP <\fIcommand\fP>

The following files are associated with the bmc driver:

.TP 
.B /platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/bmc
32\-bit \fBELF\fR kernel module for the bmc driver.
.TP 
.B /platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/amd64/bmc
64\-bit \fBELF\fR kernel module for the bmc driver.
.TP 
.B /dev/bmc
Character device node used to communicate with the bmc driver.
.SH "LIPMI INTERFACE"
The
.BR ipmitool
\fIlipmi\fP interface uses the Solaris 9 IPMI kernel device driver.
It has been superceeded by the \fIbmc\fP interface on Solaris 10.  You can tell
.BR ipmitool
to use this interface by specifying it on the command line.

> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIlipmi\fP <\fIexpression\fP>
.SH "LAN INTERFACE"
The
.BR ipmitool
\fIlan\fP interface communicates with the BMC
over an Ethernet LAN connection using UDP under IPv4.  UDP
datagrams are formatted to contain IPMI request/response 
messages with a IPMI session headers and RMCP headers.

IPMI\-over\-LAN uses version 1 of the Remote Management Control
Protocol (RMCP) to support pre\-OS and OS\-absent management.  
RMCP is a request\-response protocol delivered using UDP 
datagrams to port 623.

The LAN interface is an authentication multi\-session connection;
messages delivered to the BMC can (and should) be authenticated
with a challenge/response protocol with either straight
password/key or MD5 message\-digest algorithm.
.BR ipmitool
will attempt to connect with administrator privilege level as this
is required to perform chassis power functions.

You can tell
.BR ipmitool
to use the lan interface with the
\fB\-I\fR \fIlan\fP option:

.PP 
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIlan\fP \fB\-H\fR <\fIhostname\fP>
[\fB\-U\fR <\fIusername\fP>] [\fB\-P\fR <\fIpassword\fP>] <\fIcommand\fP>

A hostname must be given on the command line in order to use the 
lan interface with \fBipmitool\fR. The password field is optional;
if you do not provide a password on the command line,
.BR ipmitool
will attempt to connect without authentication.  If you specify a 
password it will use MD5 authentication if supported by the BMC
and straight password/key otherwise, unless overridden with a
command line option.
.SH "LANPLUS INTERFACE"
Like the \fIlan\fP interface, the \fIlanplus\fP interface
communicates with the BMC over an Ethernet LAN connection using 
UDP under IPv4.  The difference is that the \fIlanplus\fP
interface uses the RMCP+ protocol as described in the IPMI v2.0
specification.  RMCP+ allows for improved authentication and data 
integrity checks, as well as encryption and the ability to carry
multiple types of payloads.  Generic Serial Over LAN support 
requires RMCP+, so the
.BR ipmitool
\fIsol activate\fP command
requires the use of the \fIlanplus\fP interface.

RMCP+ session establishment uses a symmetric challenge\-response
protocol called RAKP (\fBRemote Authenticated Key\-Exchange Protocol\fR)
which allows the negotiation of many options.
.BR ipmitool
does not
yet allow the user to specify the value of every option, defaulting
to the most obvious settings marked as required in the v2.0 
specification.  Authentication and integrity HMACS are produced with
SHA1, and encryption is performed with AES\-CBC\-128.  Role\-level logins
are not yet supported.

.BR ipmitool
must be linked with the \fIOpenSSL\fP library in order to
perform the encryption functions and support the \fIlanplus\fP
interface.  If the required packages are not found it will not be
compiled in and supported.

You can tell
.BR ipmitool
to use the lanplus interface with the
\fB\-I\fR \fIlanplus\fP option:

.PP 
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIlanplus\fP 
\fB\-H\fR <\fIhostname\fP>
[\fB\-U\fR <\fIusername\fP>]
[\fB\-P\fR <\fIpassword\fP>]
<\fIcommand\fP>

A hostname must be given on the command line in order to use the 
lan interface with \fBipmitool\fR. With the exception of the \fB\-A\fR and
\fB\-C\fR options the rest of the command line options are identical to
those available for the \fIlan\fP interface.

The \fB\-C\fR option allows you specify the authentication, integrity,
and encryption algorithms to use for for \fIlanplus\fP session based
on the cipher suite ID found in the IPMIv2.0 specification in table
22\-20.  The default cipher suite is \fI17\fP which specifies
RAKP\-HMAC\-SHA256 authentication, HMAC\-SHA256\-128 integrity, and 
AES\-CBC\-128 encryption algorightms.

.SH "FREE INTERFACE"
.LP
The
.BR ipmitool
\fIfree\fP interface utilizes the FreeIPMI libfreeipmi
drivers.  
.LP
You can tell
.BR ipmitool
to use the FreeIPMI interface with the \-I option:
.PP
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIfree\fP <\fIcommand\fP>


.SH "IMB INTERFACE"
.LP
The
.BR ipmitool
\fIimb\fP interface supports the Intel IMB (Intel
Inter-module Bus) Interface through the /dev/imb device.  
.LP
You can tell
.BR ipmitool
to use the IMB interface with the \-I option:
.PP
> ipmitool \fB\-I\fR \fIimb\fP <\fIcommand\fP>

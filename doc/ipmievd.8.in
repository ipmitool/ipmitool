.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBipmievd\fP is a daemon which will listen for events from the
BMC that are being sent to the SEL and also log those messages to
syslog.  It is able to run in one of two modes: either using the
Event Message Buffer and asynchronous event notification from the
OpenIPMI kernel driver or actively polling the contents of the
SEL for new events.  Upon receipt of an event via either mechanism
it will be logged to syslog with the \fILOG_LOCAL4\fP facility.

It is based on the \fBipmitool\fR utility and shares the same IPMI
interface support and session setup options.  Please see the
\fBipmitool\fR manpage for more information on supported IPMI
interfaces.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-a\fR
Prompt for the remote server password.
.TP 
\fB\-A\fR <\fIauthtype\fP>
Specify an authentication type to use during IPMIv1.5 \fIlan\fP
session activation.  Supported types are NONE, PASSWORD, MD2, MD5, or OEM.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR
Present output in CSV (comma separated variable) format.  
This is not available with all commands.
.TP 
\fB\-C\fR <\fIciphersuite\fP>
The remote server authentication, integrity, and encryption algorithms
to use for IPMIv2 \fIlanplus\fP connections.  See table 22\-19 in the
IPMIv2 specification.  The default is 3 which specifies RAKP\-HMAC\-SHA1 
authentication, HMAC\-SHA1\-96 integrity, and AES\-CBC\-128 encryption algorightms.
.TP 
\fB\-E\fR
The remote server password is specified by the environment
variable \fIIPMI_PASSWORD\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-f\fR <\fIpassword_file\fP>
Specifies a file containing the remote server password. If this
option is absent, or if password_file is empty, the password
will default to NULL.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
Get basic usage help from the command line.
.TP 
\fB\-H\fR <\fIaddress\fP>
Remote server address, can be IP address or hostname.  This 
option is required for \fIlan\fP and \fIlanplus\fP interfaces.
.TP 
\fB\-I\fR <\fIinterface\fP>
Selects IPMI interface to use.  Supported interfaces that are
compiled in are visible in the usage help output.
.TP 
\fB\-L\fR <\fIprivlvl\fP>
Force session privilege level.  Can be CALLBACK, USER,
OPERATOR, ADMIN. Default is ADMIN.
.TP 
\fB\-m\fR <\fIlocal_address\fP>
Set the local IPMB address.  The default is 0x20 and there
should be no need to change it for normal operation.
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR <\fIoemtype\fP>
Select OEM type to support.  This usually involves minor hacks
in place in the code to work around quirks in various BMCs from
various manufacturers.  Use \fI\-o list\fP to see a list of
current supported OEM types.
.TP 
\fB\-O\fR <\fIsel oem\fP>
Open selected file and read OEM SEL event descriptions to be used
during SEL listings.  See examples in contrib dir for file format.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fP>
Remote server UDP port to connect to.  Default is 623.
.TP 
\fB\-P\fR <\fIpassword\fP>
Remote server password is specified on the command line.
If supported it will be obscured in the process list. 
\fBNote!\fR Specifying the password as a command line
option is not recommended.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fR <\fIsdr_cache_file\fP>
Use local file for remote SDR cache.  Using a local SDR cache
can drastically increase performance for commands that require
knowledge of the entire SDR to perform their function.
.TP 
\fB\-t\fR <\fItarget_address\fP>
Bridge IPMI requests to the remote target address.
.TP 
\fB\-U\fR <\fIusername\fP>
Remote server username, default is NULL user.
.TP 
\fB\-d \fIN\fP\fR
Use device number N to specify the /dev/ipmiN (or 
/dev/ipmi/N or /dev/ipmidev/N) device to use for in-band 
BMC communication.  Used to target a specific BMC on a 
multi-node, multi-BMC system through the ipmi device 
driver interface.  Default is 0.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR
Increase verbose output level.  This option may be specified
multiple times to increase the level of debug output.  If given
three times you will get hexdumps of all incoming and
outgoing packets.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR
Display version information.

.LP 
If no password method is specified then ipmievd will prompt the
user for a password. If no password is entered at the prompt,
the remote server password will default to NULL.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.TP 
\fIhelp\fP
This can be used to get command\-line help.  It may also be
placed at the end of commands to get option usage help.

Commands:
    open    Use OpenIPMI for asynchronous notification of events
    sel     Poll SEL for notification of events

.TP 
\fIopen\fP
This command starts ipmievd with the OpenIPMI event watching
mechanism which relies on the Event Message Buffer feature of
IPMI.  This requires a properly installed and configured
OpenIPMI driver on Linux and is only valid to be run through
the \fIopen\fP interface.  See the \fBipmitool\fR manpage
and associated documentation for more information on setting
up the OpenIPMI driver.

\fBNote\fR: Some BMC do not support the Event Message Buffer
required for this command.  Other BMCs claim to support it but
do not actually deliver events to it.  If this is the case please
use the \fIsel\fP method.

.RS
.TP 
\fIdaemon\fP
Launch process as a daemon and reparent to init process.
All messages will be sent to syslog.  This is the default action.
.TP 
\fInodaemon\fP
Do NOT become a daemon, instead log all messages to stderr.
.TP
\fIpidfile\fP=<\fBfilename\fR>
Save process ID to this file when in daemon mode.  Defaults to
/run/ipmievd.pid\fIN\fP (where \fIN\fP is the ipmi device
number -- defaults to 0).
.RE

.TP 
\fIsel\fP
This command starts ipmievd with the SEL Polling event watching
mechanism.  This will poll the SEL periodically to determine if
new events have been logged.  This command should work with all
BMCs and is capable of using the LAN interface as well to monitor
a remote system and log its events to a local syslog.
